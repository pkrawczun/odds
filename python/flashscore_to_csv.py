# Matches from www.flashscore.com/ are copy-pasted into one file at
# ../temp/LEAGUE_NAME.raw and this script translates it into
# a LEAGUE_NAME.csv file at the same location. The temp folder is not gitted.
#
# There are deviations from consistency. Apart from the usual league games,
# there are relegations play-offs etc. which need to be filtered
# out when parsing the raw file. The teams' names are duplicated for
# some reason either in seperate rows:
# TEAM_NAME
# TEAM_NAME
# or concatenated in a single line
# TEAM_NAMETEAM_NAME
# The results are concatenated as well, so a 2-1 score looks like this
# 21
# it's easy to split but if the result is 3-4 chars long, that means
# double-digits and the results must be inputted manually. It's not impractical
# because it's rare.
#
# Some single-character artefacts sometimes appear which I think might
# refer to multiple red cards so that's just going to be ignored.
#
# Each season starts with the season name in format "YYY1-YYY2" eg.
# 2025-2026.
#
# The time and date is given in format "DD.MM. HH:MM", so the year will have
# to be inferred. I will probably discard the time because some leagues
# in the database don't have them anyway and I probably won't use them.
#
# This script is only useful until flashscore changes anything about
# their formatting.
